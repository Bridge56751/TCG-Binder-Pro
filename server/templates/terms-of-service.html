    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to CardVault. By using our app, you agree to the following terms and conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using CardVault, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>CardVault is a trading card game (TCG) collection tracking application. It allows users to browse card sets, track owned cards, scan physical cards using AI identification, and view market pricing. The app supports Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, One Piece TCG, and Magic: The Gathering.</p>

    <h2>3. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>You may use CardVault as a guest with limited features (up to 20 cards). To access cloud backup and sync, you must create a free account with a valid email address. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials.</p>

    <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>CardVault offers a one-time premium upgrade for $2.99 USD (or equivalent in your local currency) that removes the card limit and unlocks unlimited scanning. All purchases are processed through Apple's App Store and are subject to Apple's terms and conditions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The premium upgrade is a one-time, non-consumable purchase.</li>
      <li>You can restore your purchase on any device by tapping "Restore Purchases" in the app's Settings or Upgrade screen.</li>
      <li>Refund requests must be submitted through Apple. CardVault does not process refunds directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. User Content</h2>
    <p>Your card collection data belongs to you. We store it to provide cloud sync functionality. You can delete your data at any time by deleting your account from Settings.</p>

    <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our servers or other users' accounts</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the app's functionality</li>
      <li>Use automated systems or bots to access the app</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>CardVault relies on third-party services including OpenAI (for card scanning), RevenueCat (for purchase management), and external TCG APIs (for card data and pricing). We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or policies of these third-party services. Card prices are provided for informational purposes only and may not reflect actual market values.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Card images, names, and related content are the property of their respective owners (The Pokemon Company, Konami, Bandai, Wizards of the Coast). CardVault does not claim ownership of any trading card intellectual property. We display card data under fair use for collection tracking purposes.</p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>CardVault is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to data loss, inaccurate pricing information, or service interruptions.</p>

    <h2>10. Account Termination</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time from the Settings screen. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
